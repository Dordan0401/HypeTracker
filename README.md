# HypeTracker

## *About*
HypeTracker is a platform for users to track upcoming Movies, TV Shows, and Games.
The front page contains the most popular of each category, or the one with the highest "Anticipation Value".
Each other page contains All of each media in a table.

Admins can upload additional media, change posters, update release dates, and remove media.

## *Planned Features*
After completed and hosted, HypeTracker will allow users to follow specific Movies, Shows, or Games and see newsfeed for each on a section of the home.
Users will also be able to upload comments to specific media, "Hype Up" (or upvote) specific media, and even see trailers for each one.
